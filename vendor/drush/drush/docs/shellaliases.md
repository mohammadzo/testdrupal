Drush Shell Aliases
===================

A Drush shell alias is a shortcut to any Drush command or any shell command. Drush shell aliases are very similar to [git aliases](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Aliases\#Advanced).

!!! note

    Shell aliases are not yet implemented in Drush 9. Please subscribe to https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/issues/2943 for updates. Help wanted.
